``reciprocalspaceship`` facilitates working with reflection data in Python. It provides
IO methods for reading/writing MTZ files, and a ``pandas``-style interface for inspecting
data and prototyping new analysis methods.

Here are a few examples to help you get started with ``reciprocalspaceship`` and highlight
some use cases.
