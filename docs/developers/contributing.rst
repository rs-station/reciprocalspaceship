Contributing to ``rs``
=======================================

We encourage you to file `Issues on GitHub <https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/reciprocalspaceship/issues>`_ if you run into any problems when using
``reciprocalspaceship``. This is also a great place to request features, suggest improvements, or
ask any questions.

We also invite you to file Pull Requests in order to help us maintain this library.
No Pull Request is too small (in fact, we encourage you to only tackle single tasks in a PR).
Contributions to the library, tests, and documentation are all welcome.
