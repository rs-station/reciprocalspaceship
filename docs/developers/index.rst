For Developers
==============

This project was started out of the `Hekstra Lab <https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu/>`_
at Harvard University in order to support the analysis of time-resolved X-ray diffraction
experiments. We soon expanded our goal to a generalized library to support writing custom
methods and analyses for diffraction experiments.

We hope that ``reciprocalspaceship`` will become a useful tool for crystallographers, and
to that end, we invite anyone to contribute to the project on
`GitHub <https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/reciprocalspaceship>`_. This guide is intended to
help you follow our best practices when contributing to the library.
